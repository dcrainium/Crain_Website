**Dani Crain spends most of her time cutting apart layers in whale earwax.**

Yes, whales have ears! But unlike you and me, they can't clean their ears. So earwax builds up in their ear canals over their entire lives, forming layers like tree rings. I use this plug of earwax, or earplug, to investigate the long-term trends in stress and sex hormones in baleen whales. 

<!--Also, I aim to make STEM graduate school and careers more inclusive (see Other Projects).-->

I like to joke that I am an ''Endochronologist,'' because I am broadly interested in using using animal tissues that grow over time to track how the environment impacts trends in stress, reproduction, diet, and location. The biomarkers I use to investigate this are hormones and nitrogen/carbon stable isotopes.

I'm currently looking for a postdoctoral position, please <u>[contact me](/#contact)</u> if you'd like to chat!

In my off time, I enjoy powerlifting, knitting, podcasting, reading science-fiction/fantasy, baking, and cooking.
