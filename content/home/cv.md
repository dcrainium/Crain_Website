I am investigating the long-term trends in stress and reproductive hormones in baleen whales using their waxy earplugs, which form layers like tree rings. Moreover, I aim to make STEM graduate school and careers more inclusive (see [Other Projects](/#otherprojects)).

I am broadly interested in using animal's hormones to help us learn more about how they respond to their environment.
