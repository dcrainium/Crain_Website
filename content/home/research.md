I reconstruct baleen whale lifetimes using the hormones in their earwax. Whales produce earwax which builds up in their ear canals over time. This earwax forms a plug that, when cut in half, shows layers similar to tree growth rings (above). Each of these layers correspond to 6 months of time and begin forming in utero until death. This means we can assign a specific age and year to each layer in the earplug. We use the hormones from these layers to show when an individual whale experiences stress, when they reach sexual maturity, and when they are pregnant. Big picture this allows us to look at the environment at the time these animals were alive. To date, we have 150 years of data from the mid-1800s to present day from more than 40 individual baleen whales, including blue, fin, humpback, gray, and minke whales.

The ability for researchers to extract hormones and contaminants from baleen whale earplugs is still very new. Some of the basic questions, like how hormones in the earplugs vary in different tissues is still unknown. Furthermore, much of the known life history for these animals is from long-term observational datasets, which can be subject to sampling biases. Earplugs do not have these same limitations.

Therefore, the focus for my PhD is: 1) assessing steroid hormone concentrations in the earplug, baleen, and blubber of the same individual baleen whales, 2) determining how three stress biomarkers vary in the same layers of an earplug of baleen whales, and 3) analyzing progesterone concentration in earplug layers to determine how many pregnancies a whale experiences in her lifetime.
