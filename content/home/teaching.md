Before starting my PhD in Biology at Baylor University in August 2015, I was an adjunct professor at [Cosumnes River College](https://www.crc.losrios.edu/), where I taught Anatomy & Physiology and Foundations of Biology, and [California State University Sacramento](https://www.csus.edu/), where I taught Human Reproductive Physiology.

Currently, I am a teacher of record and have taught lab courses for anatomy & physiology for nursing track students as well as introductory biology at Baylor University. In Spring 2017 I won the [Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award](https://www.baylor.edu/graduate/currentstudents/index.php?id=98859) while teaching Bio 2401, Anatomy & Physiology.
