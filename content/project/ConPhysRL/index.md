Researchers increasingly examine hormone trends of animals using continuously growing biological matrices, like baleen whale earplugs. We compare four corresponding sets of earplugs from the same individuals to 1) determine comparability of absolute hormones in right and left earplugs and 2) standardize lifetime hormones by baseline-corrected or Z-score normalized hormones.
