I joined WISE at Baylor in the summer of 2017 and quickly became co-organizer of the Graduate Student Seminar Speaker Series, the brain child of fellow graduate studentand co-organizer Suzanne Nolan. Baylor WISE's mission statement is to support each other, make STEM more inclusive, and mentor new faculty.
