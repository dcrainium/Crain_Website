I founded CEGSS with fellow graduate student Felicia Osburn in the summer of 2018. Our mission statement is to increase the feeling of community among Biology graduate students by providing members with an outlet to practice presentations, participate in community outreach, and participate in professional development activities together. 

With the help of many of my fellow graduate students at Baylor University, I created the CEGSS handbook and timeline. The [CEGSS handbook](/pdf/CEGSS_Handbook_2019-2020_FINAL.pdf) is sent out to all Biology graduate students, with the hope it will help first years hit the ground running. The handbook also includes a timeline at the end, which notes key check points in a PhD at Baylor, along with resources and the time during a PhD those resources will be most useful.
