How do cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone compare to one another in the earplug of a baleen whale? Recently, researcher Dr. Kathleen Hunt found corticosterone is present in higher concentrations in the baleen of these whales than cortisol. Furthermore, Dr. Elizabeth Burgess has also found aldosterone may vary with stress in right whales. Because of their research, I wanted to investigate these hormones in the earplugs and assess how they vary with each other over the lifetime of these whales.
